My mission is to contribute to building AI systems that are Robust, Safe and ideally as Data Efficient as humans<sup style="color:#b1040e;">1</sup>. I have broad interest in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Language Grounding (Language+Vision).

Currently I work at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) as a Senior Researcher, serve as an advisor for [Koidra](https://www.koidra.ai/) and as Associate Editor for IEEE Signal Processing Magazine [Newsletter](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/newsletter). I have had the priviledge to be a Senior member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/), to serve as part of organizing committee of [ACL 2020](https://acl2020.org/) as one of the virtual infrastructure chairs, to work as a mentor at [Microsoft AI School](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-school) from 2017 to 2019 and [Microsoft AI Residency Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-ai-residency-program/) from 2019 to 2020, and to have R&D collaboration with various Microsoft product teams in Microsoft Azure (image captioning, hate speech detection), Office (document recommendation), Bing (text-image retrieval) and CELA (developing an intitial NLP system to understand legal contracts).

I have a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) advised by [Rabab Ward](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=dqsw1u8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Li Deng](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=GQWTo4MAAAAJ&hl=en) where I worked on [Sparse Decomposition and Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04924) and [Deep Sentence Representations for Web Search Engines and Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06922) which received [IEEE Signal Processing Society Best Paper Award 2018](). My MSc and BSc were in Electrical Engineering and I am still an [engineer at heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer).

For general inquiries please contact me at [hamidpalangi [at] ieee [dot] org](hamidpalangi@ieee.org), for Microsoft related inquiries please contact me at [hpalangi [at] microsoft [dot] com](hpalangi@microsoft.com).

<sup style="color:#b1040e; font-size:0.7em;">1</sup> <span style="font-size:0.7em;">It has been found in previous studies of language that a child hears or produces about 8 million words in 15 months between the ages 9 to 24 months, or around 3 million words per year reported in another study [[1](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/41/12663),[2](https://www.amazon.ca/Meaningful-Differences-Everyday-Experience-American/dp/1557661979),[3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00955.pdf)]. Recent large scale deep neural networks will need significantly more data, e.g, GPT3 model consumes 499 billion words during pre-training [[4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf)]. </span>

**[2020](){: .btn--research}** Are the tasks/datasets that machine learning researchers use for natural language reasoning grounded in vision (visual question answering) actually measure the *reasoning* capability of the models? Or they are more of a competition about who has a better vision backbone (*perception*) that might be publicly available for others or not? Our recent work proposing a Neuro-Symbolic approach that disentangles reasoning from perception to address this issue has been accepted at [ICML 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11524.pdf).

**[2020](){: .btn--research}** Leveraging Neuro-Symbolic representations to solve math problems helps us to better understand neural models and impose necessary discrete inductive biases into them.
