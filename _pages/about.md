My research interests are in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Currently I am passionate about contributing to the understanding, control, and training of foundation models.

I work as Principal Researcher at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/), Affiliate Associate Professor at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) and serve as an advisor for [Koidra](https://www.koidra.ai/). I am a Senior member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) and have had the priviledge to serve as Area Editor for IEEE Signal Processing Magazine [Newsletter](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/newsletter), to be part of the organizing committee of [ACL 2020](https://acl2020.org/) as one of the virtual infrastructure chairs, to work as a mentor at [Microsoft AI School](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-school) from 2017 to 2019 and [Microsoft AI Residency Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-ai-residency-program/) from 2019 to 2020. I have had R&D collaboration with various Microsoft product teams in Microsoft Cogitive Services ([image captioning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/expanding-scene-and-language-understanding-with-large-scale-pre-training-and-a-unified-architecture/)), Azure ([hate speech detection](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/detoxigen-leveraging-large-language-models-to-build-more-robust-hate-speech-detection-tools/) which resulted in ToxiGen that has been used in [Llama2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288), [Code Llama](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12950), [Orca2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11045), [phi-1.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05463) and also to detect toxicity in [Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00220) and <span style="color:#b1040e">Econ Forums[[1](https://www.nber.org/affiliated-scholars/researchspotlight/2023-florian-ederer-anonymity-and-identity-online-empirical-study), [2](https://florianederer.github.io/ejmr.pdf)]</span>), Office (document recommendation), Bing ([New Bing](https://www.bing.com/new), text-image retrieval) and CELA (an intitial NLP system to understand legal contracts).

I have a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering where I worked on [Sparse Decomposition and Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04924) and [Deep Sentence Representations for Web Search Engines and Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06922) which received [IEEE Signal Processing Society Best Paper Award 2018](). My M.Sc. and B.Sc. were in Electrical Engineering.

**[2020](){: .btn--research}** Are the tasks/datasets that machine learning researchers use for natural language reasoning grounded in vision (visual question answering) actually measure the *reasoning* capability of the models? Or they are more of a competition about who has a better vision backbone (*perception*) that might be publicly available for others or not? Our recent work proposing a Neuro-Symbolic approach that disentangles reasoning from perception to address this issue has been accepted at [ICML 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11524.pdf).

**[2020](){: .btn--research}** Leveraging Neuro-Symbolic representations to solve math problems helps us to better understand neural models and impose necessary discrete inductive biases into them. What are the necessary ingredients for these types of structures for being efficient in these reasoning tasks? In our recent effort we propose an approach that will be presented at [ICML 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02339.pdf).
