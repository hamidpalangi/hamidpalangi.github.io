My first 10 KM run was the year after my father passed away in 2013, participating in the [Vancouver Sun Run](https://www.vancouversunrun.com/) as part of the ECE UBC team. I did one 10K per week afterwards over the weekend running from [UBC campus](https://www.ubc.ca/our-campuses/vancouver/) to [Vancouver Downtown](https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/downtown.aspx). After moving to US and my knee injury I have been doing weekly 10K walks since 2020. Below are a few books I have listened to during these 10Ks, sharing them here in case you find them helpful. If you are in the area and want to do a 10K, let me know!
